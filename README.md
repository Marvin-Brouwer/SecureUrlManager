# SecureUrlManager

A URL shortener with an admin panel behind it using `Microsoft Entra ID`.  
It will provide you with a very simple and recognizable website, allowing for recognizable company urls. Plus it will allow you to track any usage in the case a bad url has been clicked.

## Using the project

The basic idea is that you clone the repo, update the configs and deploy it yourself.

TODO:

- Create API
- Write wire-frames
- Create web UI
- Setup IAC scripts in polumi perhaps for easy setup
- Write getting started docs
- Write admin docs
